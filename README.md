Click on a pokemon listed and it's image will appear. Then, if you click on this image a modal will appear showing you the type associated with the pokemon. Click on the x in the upper left hand corner of the modal to close it.

Also if the screen becomes less than 760 pixels wide the pokemon listed will stack vertically and you can scroll up and down to see all the names.


A fun thing you can do with the app is add a limit (e.g. ?limit=20&offset=100) to the initial get request to pull different pokemon. Some don't have sprites so the functionality won't work there. There are 1050 pokemon in the API.
